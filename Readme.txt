Here are some NLP projects. For the moment, the only real project is the one I did during a one month internship at the Departement 
Science des donnees, Service central de renseignement criminel (SRCR), Gendarmerie Nationale.

I learned the Spacy library in order to do text classification. I also discovered some basic concepts of NLP and the work of the
researchers of the department, and I attended several AI conferences organized by public authorities.


						*** Architecture of the project ***


The project is to be found inside the TextClassification directory. It contains the Jeopardy folder, in which there is my internship
project.

In the Jeopardy folder, there is the Data folder, inside which we found the Jeopardy dataset. 

You'll find the python script of the project named jeopardy_v4_2_cats_only

There is a also readme file in the jeopardy project explaining the project made during the internship in more details.
