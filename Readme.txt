Here are some NLP projects. For the moment, the only real project is the one I did during a one month internship at the Departement 
Science des donnees, Service central de renseignement criminel (SRCR), Gendarmerie Nationale.

I learned the Spacy library in order to do text classification. I also discovered some basic concepts of NLP and the work of the
researchers of the department, and I attended several AI conferences organized by public authorities.

There is a readme file in the jeopardy project explaining the project made during the internship in more details.
